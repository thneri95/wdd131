## 🎓 About the Course

The **WDD131 - Dynamic Web Fundamentals** course at BYU-Idaho taught me how to go from structure to strategy in web design. This repo is my playground of:

- ✅ Semantic HTML5
- 🎨 Advanced CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- 🔧 JavaScript (DOM, Events, localStorage)
- 🚀 Performance & UX Optimization
- 🧠 Real Version Control using Git + GitHub

## 💼 Real Project: T2 Smart Finance Portal

🧩 **Not just theory — this is real.**  
My final project is a **real business portal** that integrates everything I’ve learned.

> 💬 **Note:** The use of contrast is **intentional**—it's a proven UX technique to emphasize calls to action and guide the user visually.
