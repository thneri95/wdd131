## ✨ Project Overview

Welcome to **T2 Smart Finance** – the final project developed by **Tiago Neri** for the **WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals** course at **BYU-Idaho**.

Rather than creating a generic prototype, I chose to build something real and meaningful — a fully functional website that I will actively use in my own **financial consulting company, T2**. This platform was designed to guide users through personal finance with clarity and real utility — including **interactive calculators**, educational content, and actionable strategies.

T2 is focused on delivering powerful, accessible financial education to individuals across the **United States**, helping people make smarter decisions about budgeting, saving, investing, and planning for their future.

🔍 Our focus: **Budgeting | Saving | Investing | Financial Planning**
