## ✨ Project Overview


Welcome to **T2 Smart Finance** – my capstone project developed for the **WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals** course at **BYU-Idaho**.

Rather than building a theoretical prototype, I developed a **fully functional and useful** website that I will actively utilize in **T2**, my financial consulting company. This platform empowers users with **clear, actionable insights into personal finance**

T2 Smart Finance is designed to deliver **accessible financial education** and **interactive tools** to individuals across the **United States**. It's a robust, real-world tool for better decisions about budgeting, saving, investing, and long-term planning

🔍 **Our Core Focus:** Budgeting | Saving | Investing | Financial Planning
